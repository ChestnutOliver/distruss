# Distruss
A Lemmy instance with blackjack and freedom paranoia.

## About The Project

Distruss is an unaffiliated tributary of the [Lemmy project](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy) which plans, unless upstream decisions make it impossible, to remain compatible with the coming Lemmy [fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse). In the words of the upstream project:

> Lemmy is similar to sites like Reddit, Lobste.rs, Raddle, or Hacker News: you subscribe to forums you're interested in, post links and discussions, then vote, and comment on them. Behind the scenes, it is very different; anyone can easily run a server, and all these servers are federated (think email), and connected to the same universe, called the Fediverse.

## Development Process

New Lemmy releases are regularly `git merge --squash`ed into the master branch. If you are contributing a feature or bugfix that would help all Lemmy instances, please [consider forking the main project](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy) and submitting your pull requests there. It will trickle downstream to Distruss in due course and reduce our maintenance burden.

Otherwise please [raise an issue](https://github.com/distruss/distruss/issues) to let us know what problem you're having / working on.

[See the Lemmy documentation](https://dev.lemmy.ml/docs/index.html) for help building Distruss on your local machine or deploying via Docker, etc. It all also applies to Distruss.

## Support / Donate

Please direct financial support and volunteer hours first to [the Lemmy project itself](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy).
